KinectCapture Documentation
================================================================================
KinectCapture is a user-friendly modified freenect front-end software to capture Kinect raw data.

----------------
Version History
----------------
---0.3.3----
Fixed bugs related to changes in modes.
---0.3.2----
Added new file format.
Added waiting for device to connect.
---0.3.1----
Added Settings Menu.
Fixed Memory Leaks.
----0.3-----
Added multiple kinects support.
Added looping in program mode.
----0.2-----
Added under-exposure and overexposure display.
Corrected mode-6 10bit IR image display. 

-----------
Compilation
-----------
KinectCapture requires the following libraries and IDEs to get compiled
a) freenect (modified) - in the lib32, lib64, libw32 folders
b) pthread
c) gtk
d) gtkglext
e) gl, glu
f) code-blocks.

--------------
User Interface
--------------
The user-interface consists of the real-time depth and rgb/ir display with optional histogram display for rgb/ir. The menu consists of 'Load Program' item to load a valid program. The lower end of the user interface contains the Write Register, Write CMOS Register, Run program, Brightness Set input options.

-------------------
Keyboard Shortcuts
-------------------
1 - mode 1 (RGB 640X480 8bit + Depth 640X480 8bit).
2 - mode 2 (YUV-RGB 640X480 8bit + Depth 640X480 8bit).
3 - mode 3 (IR 640X480 8bit + Depth 640X480 8bit).
4 - mode 4 (RGB 1280X1024 8bit + Depth 640X480 8bit).
5 - mode 5 (IR 1280X1024 8bit).
6 - mode 6 (IR 1280X1024 10bit).
c - captures current mode.
d - toggles depth display.
e - toggles exposure display.
f - cycles through all modes.
h - toggles histogram display.
m - depth smoothing off.
n - depth smoothing on.
p - toggles projector.
q - switches among multiple kinects.
r - runs loaded program if any.
s - resets angle to 0.
w - increases tilt angle.
x - decreases tilt angle.

----------------------------
Programming in KinectCapture
----------------------------
To load a program in memory, check program mode on the main window.
Goto File menu>Load Program and select the program file.
Only on valid program, the Run button/ 'r' keyboard shortcut will be enabled.

------------------------
Structure of the program
------------------------
Every program must start with the keyword START and end with the keyword STOP.

Comments are allowed at any line except lines that contain codes. e.g.
% this a demo program.

----------------
Program keywords
----------------
All keywords are case-sensitive. The valid keywords are given below.

START - start of a program.
STOP - end of a program.
PAUSE <milliseconds> - pauses the code for <milliseconds> ms.
MODE <value> - changes the current mode to <value> which must be in 1-6 range.
CAPTURE - captures current mode in memory.
SAVE - saves captured data to raw file format.
PROJECTOR - toggles projector.
BRIGHTNESS <value> - changes the ir brightness to <value> level which must be in 0-50 range.
SWITCH <value> - change current device to kinect number <value> for multiple kinects. (-1 for next kinect)
LOOP <value> - beginning of a loop for <value> times.
END - end of a loop.

------------------------------
Capturing data through program
------------------------------
For example to capture all the depth, rgb and ir images, all the required modes need to be captured. e.g. in 640X480 resolution, one must capture both mode 1/2 (for depth and rgb) and mode 3 (for depth and ir) as in the demo program below.

% this a demo program to capture all data
START
% change to mode 1
MODE 1
% pause to stabilize the images
PAUSE 1000
% capture depth and rgb
CAPTURE
% change to mode 3
MODE 3
% pause to stabilize the images
PAUSE 1000
% capture depth and ir, note depth will be overwritten
CAPTURE
% now save the captured data
SAVE
STOP
